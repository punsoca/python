1) function 'call_func_twice_no_threading()' - one function called twice, no threading.
   RESULT:  Total execution time is approximately 2 seconds (2.01) - one second per call.

Total execution time is 2.01 second(s)

2) function 'run_two_threads_async()' - create two threads to run the same function.
   RESULT:  Total execution time shows 0.00 seconds. This is because the threading function does not specify to WAIT 
            for the threads to finish execution before proceeding to execute the rest of the lines in the function.
            NOTE that 'Done sleeping...' shows up after the 'Finish executing our two threads' is printed.

3) function 'run_two_threads_with_join()' - create two threads to run the same function - this time using the .join() method.
   The .join() method tells Python to wait until the thread(s) finish execution before executing the rest of the script.
   RESULT:  (a) Total execution time shows 1.00 seconds - showing that the two threads were able to run in parallel.
            (b) Note that the print statements are now showing the expected order - 'Done sleep' now comes BEFORE 
               'Finish executing our two threads' is printed.

4) function 'run_ten_threads_with_threadlist()' - creating 10 threads using a threadlist. Each thread running with sleep timer of one second,
   RESULT:  Total execution time shows ~ 1.00 seconds - demonstrating that the all 10 threads were able to run concurrently.

5) function 'conc_futures_threading' - using 'concurrent.futures.ThreadPool' class' executor object to create 'future' objects when running submit() method.
   Each future object is assigned a different time.sleep() value by the executor.submit method(). 
   RESULT:  Total execution time shows ~ 1.00 seconds - demonstrating that the all 10 futures object in the ThreadPool were able to run concurrently.

6) function 'conc_futures_thrd_context_mgr' - same as 'conc_futures_threading' function but written as context manager.
   RESULT:  Same result as 'conc_futures_threading' function, with total execution time ~ 2 seconds (with difference only in milliseconds)

7) function 'conc_futures_thrd_as_completed' - using the concurrent.futures 'as_completed' method.
   Creates 10 futures objects with varying time.sleep() value, longest of which is five seconds.
   RESULT:  Total execution time is still ~ 5 seconds (with difference only in milliseconds).

8) function 'conc_futures_thrd_with_executor_map' - using the executor.map() to replace executor.submit() in creating futures objects.
   Creates 10 futures objects with varying time.sleep() value, longest of which is five seconds.
   RESULT:  Total execution time is still ~ 5 seconds (with difference only in milliseconds).

9) function 'conc_futures_thrd_with_max_workers' - same as 'conc_futures_thrd_with_executor_map' except that we are passing the
   "max_workers" value to the threaded function.  

   Creates 10 futures objects with varying time.sleep() value, longest of which is five seconds.

   RESULT:  For this function, we assigned max_workers=5  - this causes our ThreadPool to allow "only"  5 futures objects to run concurrently
   causing the execution time to run LONGER than the desired 5 seconds.  The test here shows total execution time of  9 seconds. 

... Function "conc_futures_thrd_with_max_workers()" ...

max_workers = 5
